# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to calculate and visualize ride sharing statistics for PyBer from January-April 2019.

# Results
The data showed some interesting results. Looking at the summary table below, Rural had the highest Average Fare per Driver. Why might that be? Looking at the Total Drivers column gives some insight, showing that Rural has 3% the number of drivers that Urban has. That's a HUGE difference. Average Fare per Ride is also the highest in Rural cities as well. Why? Well one reason could be because Rural areas are more spread out, thus having to travel further. But the data set provided did not have distance driven for each ride, so we don't know if Rural was further or not. Something else to consider is that Rural while having the highest Average Fare per Driver and Ride, it also has by far the lowest Total Ride Count, less than 10% of Urban for example.

This next image shows the Fares summed up by Week for each city type. Each ciy type shows a spike around the last week of February. Could be due to a major holiday that's shared across the region, but more data and research would be needed. All three types do show a straight-ish line from Jan-Apr, indicating no major rise/drop in fares. If 12 months of data were provided rather than 4, any seasonality could be discovered as well. Urban and Suburban do both show growth starting at the beginning of January compared to Rural which has a drop off.

# Summary
Based on these results, I have come up with a few business recommendations:

1. Given the vast differences in rider demand between the city types, I would suggest increasing research/marketing in rural areas because they have by far the lowest ride count, even though Rural has the highest Average Fare per Ride/Driver.
2. With number of drivers outnumbering rides in Urban areas, whereas in Suburban and Rural it's the opposite, I would direct incentives to Urban areas in attempt to increase ridership.
3. With Suburban having 20% the drivers that Urban does, but actually makes 50% the Total Fares of Urban, I would look further into what the differences are between driver groupings, ride time of day, etc to see if any strengths from Suburban could be applied to Urban and Rural as well.
